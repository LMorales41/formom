            <h1>Welcome to My Mom's Nail Services</h1>
            <p>To Santa Monica folks! Had your fill of the same old beaches? Give Long Beach a shot, and while you're at it, swing by my mom's nail salon. I guarantee you the full set of killer nails to show off afterward and a great experience. If you had enough of Snapchat chats, how about a chat with my mom while having your nails done? If she knew English better, she could have been a stand-up comedian. But as a nail worker, she can still make you laugh by tickling your funny bone (and maybe your feet too)!</p>
